## Simple tools for RimWorld


### Planned features:
* Backup settings and mods. Initial goal.
* GUI? On the fence, here
* MacOS support. Maybe one day. I don't currently have a Mac.
* Linux support.
* Find install location based on Steam library configurations. Registry?
* DRM free version support.
* Workshop mod support for DRM free?
* Modpack system?

### Notes
* There are no libraries for iterating all steam libraries anywhere, so
  I'll have to implement one myself. Definitely something to implement
  after core functionality.
